# Circuit Solver  :))  ***Short your time, we open your answer***

**Have you ever fed up of solving complicated circuits with lots of bridges and pillars ?**

*Fret Not!! You have then reached the right place, this is a computer aided software, that solves you any kind of resistive circuit instantly in no pain.*

## Features

* You can solve any kind of resistive circuit.
* This can solve complicated circuits with any type of controlled sources too. 
* Easy to handle user interface, as simple as filling a form.
* Images displyed for each type of the element to user for enterring the correct input.

## Working principle
We have algorithmically implemented the technique of ***Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA)*** for solving any kind of resistive circuit. MNA is an advanced version of the existing principle of nodal analysis, in which some changes are made so as to implement it using any computer program. This is our basic implementation of the complete project of a circuit solver. In this preliminary version we have just implemented the backend process of MNA. Here the user must do all the node planning and enter the correct inputs(number of elements, number of nodes, each element type and it's details) as prompted by the software. 

## Implementation
Built using Bootstrap framework for responsive design, math.js for mathematical calculations and animate.css for animations.

## Contributions
We do welcome any kind of contributions, feel free to fork it and create a pull requests. Whenever you find any kind of bugs in the code or any optimization in the code feel free to contribute to us. 

## Disclaimer
This is a computer aided software and hence there is no gaurentee by the developers for ensuring the creditability of the results that the software outputs. Though the softare has been tested against a large number of custom inputs, there are situations where it can fail. If you come across any such problem, please feel free to rise a issue here or provide your feedback in the website and we will try to address the issue as soon as possible.
